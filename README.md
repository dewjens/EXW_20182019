Flex bird 


Once upon a time there was a bird. This bird wasn’t like any other bird, he was stronger, way stronger than any of his species. Flex bird was born with 6 arms but no wings unlike his brothers. 
Flex bird didn’t have the ability to fly without his wings, so he began working out until the point that he became so strong that he could transport himself while flexing his strong arms.
